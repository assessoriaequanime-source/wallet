    <title>AI-Powered Crypto Trading Platform</title>
    <meta name="description" content="We’re building a crypto trading platform that combines a clean, fast frontend with an AI-powered
engine for market insights. The idea is to give traders one place where they can track markets,
analyze tokens, and get real-time signals across multiple blockchains.
Right now, we’re still early. The frontend is in development, and we’re starting to shape the
backend and blockchain side. Because of that, we’re looking for developers who want to help us
build the core of the platform from the ground up.">
